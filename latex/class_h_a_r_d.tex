\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A derived class representing the \doxylink{class_h_a_r_d}{HARD} difficulty settings. 

This class sets the parameters for the \doxylink{class_h_a_r_d}{HARD} difficulty level, with fewer platforms and a lower chance for bonuses. The platform types are more evenly distributed, and the platform distance is higher.
